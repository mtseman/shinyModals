Description: Functions for extending shinydashboard functionality. Functions are in the form of shiny modules and generally focus on expanding functionality of existing dshboard elements such as shiny Modal Dialog and InfoBox.
    For example, RobustActionButton is a shiny action button but with TryCatch functionality to send the user an error message in a modal box instead of booting the user from the server. The package has several such functions that 
    mix existing shiny elements to create helpful mini modules
